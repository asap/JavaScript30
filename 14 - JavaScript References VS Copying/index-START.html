    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    team5[3] = 'Moe';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {

    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    // console.log(captain, person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: '12' } );

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person};
    captain3.number = 27;
    console.log(captain3, person);
